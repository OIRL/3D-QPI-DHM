# 3D QPI-DHM

3D QPI-DHM is a implementation develipes in collaboration between the Optical Imaging Research Laboratory in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth and the Applied Optics Research Group in the School of Applied Sciences and Engineering at Universidad EAFIT in Medellin, Colombia. 3D QPI-DHM is free tool that provides three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of quantitative phase distributions from a defocused hologram. The proposed method developed a synergistic computational framework to compensate for the linear tilt introduced in off-axis DHM systems and autofocus the defocused holograms by minimizing a cost function, providing in-focus reconstructed phase images without phase distortions.
